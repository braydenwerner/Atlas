Uploading:

Thoughts:
Localstorage seems to be good for storing Todos because it is quick.
The issue is, the database should contain the todos incase they are deleted
somehow. Use localstorage if exists, otherwise fetch from database? I'm not
sure if this is how things are supposed to be done.
For simplicitly, will just store settings/preferences in local storage
and more permanent stuff in the database. Todos will be in the database and
will be fetched from the server on page load.

It looks like many sites call from the database if localstorage returns null
then saves the data in localstorage for quicker access.

Or maybe they are using localstorage until that gets overriden by
the database call afterwards. So while you are fetching from database
you still have the previous local storage data?

Todos:
Store all todos by a user, with a flag isCompleted and a date isCompleted
